Hey, you
I would like to meet you when the day is gone
My heart's trembling and I'm turning
Round and round

Looking at your photograph
Can't forget the way you laugh
You have changed the way I feel
I feel inside

My heart is feeling something new
Changing every black to blue
Every day you're on my mind
I've lost control

REFRAIN:
Danger, danger
Can't you hear me crying, crying
Oh-oh danger, danger
I can't get away
How could I live without you

Danger, danger
Is it love I'm feeling, feeling
Oh-oh danger, danger

I have lost my heart
You mean everything to me
I just know: you got my heart
And now you want my soul

Hey, you
Hey, you
I'm trembling and I'm turning
Round and round

My heart is feeling something new
Changing every black to blue
You have changed the way I feel
I feel inside

Looking straight into your face
Waiting for your sweet embrace
Feel that you can read my mind
I lose control

Danger, danger
Can't you hear me crying, crying
Oh-oh danger, danger
I can't get away
How could I live without you

Danger, danger
Is it love I'm feeling, feeling
Oh-oh danger, danger

I have lost my heart
You mean everything to me
I just know: you got my heart
And now you want my soul

Danger, danger
Can't you hear me crying, crying
Oh-oh danger, danger
I can't get away
How could I live without you

Danger, danger
Is it love I'm feeling, feeling
Oh-oh danger, danger
I have lost my heart
